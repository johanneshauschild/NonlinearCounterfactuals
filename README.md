# Nonlinear Counterfactuals

This repository contains an Isabelle/HOL formalisation of David Lewis' Counterfactual Operators from his 1973 Book *Counterfactuals*.
It also formalises improved versions of Lewis Operators as introduced through Finkbeiner and Siber in their 2023 paper "Counterfactuals Modulo Temporal Logics".
Furthermore it contains an formalisation of CTL\*, performing a comparison between CTL\*s expressive power and the expressive power of the counterfactual *Would* operator.
